# Z-Phone

Welcome to **Z-Phone**, the open-source initiative that transforms the in-game mobile experience in FiveM by introducing a sleek, iPhone-inspired design that prioritizes simplicity and elegance.

## Objective

Our goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly phone interface that enhances the gameplay experience without overwhelming players. By focusing on essential features and an intuitive layout, we hope to make communication in the game more enjoyable and immersive.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by **QBPhone** from **QBCore**, combining its core functionalities with a fresh aesthetic that appeals to modern users. Our redesign aims to modernize the user experience while retaining the familiar features players love.

## Dependencies

- **[ESX Core](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core "ESX Core")**: This project relies on the ESX framework for core functionalities.
- here was a dependency for qb_banking, you do not need esx_banking for this version.
- **[OX Lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib "OX Lib")**: OX Lib is also required to ensure seamless integration with existing systems.
- **[OX Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory "OX Inventory")**: OX Inventory is also required for item handling.

## Tech Stack

We are using the following technologies to build this project:

- **React.js**: For creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To style our components with a utility-first approach, ensuring a clean and modern design.
